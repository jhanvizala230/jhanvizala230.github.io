# **About Me**

Hi, I’m **{{ site.author.name }}** 👩‍💻✨ :wave:

Welcome to my corner of the internet! I’m a Software Engineer & Machine Learning Specialist with 3+ years in building cloud-native APIs, scalable systems, and advanced AI pipelines. I engineer:

- LLMs & Generative AI agents
- Multilingual TTS + VITS architectures
- ML pipelines, model finetuning, and MLOps
- Scalable GCP, Azure AKS, and K8s deployments

I’ve shipped impactful AI products across document automation, speech synthesis, and image segmentation, blending engineering with research to move ideas into the real world.

When I’m not wrangling models and containers, you’ll find me flowing on the yoga mat, dancing to reset, or painting to recharge.

Dive in and check out some of my builds 🚀
