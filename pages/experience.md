### Machine Learning Engineer  

**Role:** Machine Learning Engineer  
**Company:** Vosyn, Toronto, Canada (Remote)  
**Duration:** Nov 2024 ‚Äì May 2025  

As a Machine Learning Engineer, I worked on cutting-edge multilingual speech synthesis and transcript analysis systems, focusing on modularity, performance, and deployment at scale.

content="
<br>

###### Project Goal:

Develop a modular multilingual and multispeaker Text-to-Speech (TTS) system capable of:

- Translating any supported language text into high-quality audio.  
- Supporting speaker accent replication and diverse voice characteristics.  
- Enhancing speech naturalness, fidelity, and intelligibility.  
- Integrating into scalable cloud production pipelines with cost optimization.

###### My Role: 
  As the lead intern on this module, I contributed to both core modeling and team leadership by enhancing architecture, optimizing deployment, and guiding junior contributors.

  **Architecture Enhancement:** 
  - Modified the original VITS architecture to include a custom synthesizer layer.  
  - Enabled multilingual and multispeaker support from combined datasets of diverse languages, phonemes, and speaker profiles.

  **Data Preparation:**  
  - Created a 10GB custom dataset by aggregating and preprocessing open-source datasets.  
  - Ensured data compatibility through audio-transcript alignment and phoneme annotation.

  **Training Infrastructure:**  
  - Trained on Google Vertex AI using T4 GPUs (n1-standard-16).  
  - Isolated environments using Docker for reproducible training and testing.  
  - Automated end-to-end training with Vertex AI Pipelines.

  **Evaluation & Optimization:**  
  - Used Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and Word Error Rate (WER) for evaluation.  
  - Improved MOS by 6.7% over the baseline.  
  - Introduced checkpoint-based fine-tuning, cutting cloud training costs by ~15%.

  **Team Leadership:**  
  - Mentored and managed 5 junior engineers.  
  - Reviewed code, led sprint planning, and facilitated knowledge sharing sessions.

###### Teck Stack

**Modeling & ML:** PyTorch, Modified VITS, NumPy, SciPy, Librosa  
**Data Engineering:** FFmpeg, Pandas, phoneme extraction scripts  
**Cloud:** Google Cloud Platform (Vertex AI, Firestore, Cloud Storage), Docker  
**Evaluation:** MOS, WER, Phoneme Sequence Error (PSEQ)  
**DevOps:** Git, Docker, CI/CD Pipelines  
**Collaboration:** Notion, code reviews, team mentorship

{% include elements/collapse.html title="üì∫ Multilingual YouTube Transcript Summarization & Search System"
content="

<br>

###### Project Goal:
Build a multilingual system to process and summarize YouTube content with search and playback features:

- Extract transcripts in any language.  
- Summarize long-form video transcripts via chunk-based analysis.  
- Store semantic embeddings for searchable video playback.  
- (Planned scope) Translate and generate synchronized audio overlays.

###### My Role: 
As the system's primary designer and developer, I led all components from architecture to cloud deployment.

  **Framework Design & Transcript Pipeline:**  
  - Used YouTube API to fetch metadata and multilingual transcripts.  
  - Handled video lengths up to 1 hour with transcripts spanning hundreds of lines.

  **Multilingual Summarization with Gemini 3:**  
  - Integrated Google Gemini 3 for summarization.  
  - Chunked transcripts and mapped each to its corresponding video timecode.  
  - Generated frame-aligned summaries with duration metadata.

  **Semantic Search via Vector DB:**  
  - Generated embeddings using Sentence-Transformers.  
  - Stored vectors in a FAISS database for semantic search and segment retrieval.

  **Metadata Mapping:**  
  - Mapped summaries to video frame ranges and durations.  
  - Prepared for future translation and synced playback integration.

  **Cloud Deployment:**  
  - Deployed using Google Vertex AI (T4 GPU, n1-standard-16).  
  - Each pipeline stage containerized via Docker and orchestrated using Vertex AI Pipelines.

  **Team Collaboration:**  
  - Worked independently with architectural feedback from senior engineers.  
  - Contributed documentation and shared insights across platform teams.

###### Tech Stack:
**Transcript & Video:** YouTube API, Pytube, Whisper (fallback), FFmpeg  
**Summarization:** Google Gemini 3, LangDetect, text chunking  
**Semantic Search:** Sentence-Transformers, FAISS, cosine similarity  
**Cloud:** Google Cloud (Vertex AI, Pipelines, Firestore, Cloud Storage), Docker  
**Backend:** Python, FastAPI, modular microservice architecture
